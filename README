The Contiki OS
--------------

This repository holds a modified version of the Contiki OS. The
platforms have been modified to interoperate without any further
changes to the setting. Currently, the following platforms
interoperate:

     - AVR Raven (avr-raven)
     - Telos B / TMote SKy (sky)
     - Redbee Econotag (redbee-econotag)

A network consisting of the all the above motes, interoperating 
using the Contiki RPL implementation has been tested to work.

The Contiki Operating System

Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power
microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that
make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized
low-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.

Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-commercial systems,
such as city sound monitoring, street lights, networked electrical
power meters, industrial monitoring, radiation monitoring,
construction site monitoring, alarm systems, remote house monitoring,
and so on.
